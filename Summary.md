---
What is Human Computer Interaction?
> “Human-computer interaction is a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them.”

What is interaction Design?
> “Designing interactive products to support the way people
communicate and inter5tact in their everyday and working lives.”

- Visibility (of System State)
- Affordance (suggest possible actions

# Perception & Cognition
*Metaphors help learning*, can be *limiting*

Future Interfaces go beyond Desktop




---
# Input & Output
- Interaction with computers is mediated by Perception and Action
	- Perception (Sensory System), Action (Motor System)
  	- Visual, auditory, haptic systems work in combination
  	- the Model Human Processor provides a simplified view
- Memory
   - Long-term memory contains our world knowledge   
   - Short-term memory is place of cognitive processes
   - Sensory memories contain raw data
   		- Attention required to interpret 
- Skill
	- Practice leads to skill
	- Reduces cognitive effort  

---
- Input and output need to be adapted
	- to dexterity and limited senses
- Speed / Accuracy Tradeoff
	- Fitts’ Law models speed-accuracy tradeoff in pointing
-  Input enables communcation
- Text input is key
- Precise pointing is important
- Various output technologies

# Design Process 1
- Design Process
- Users
- Requirements
- Task-Centered Design and Scenarios
Initial Design Techniques
	- Brainstorming
	- Sketching
	- Storyboarding



---
# Design Process 2
## Interviews
- Ask a small number of people
- Flexible methods
	- structured
	- unstructured
	- semi structured

## Questionnaires
- Ask a large number of people
- little Controll over conditions

## Observations
- Capture context of use
- Expensive to analyze results

## Pact Analysis
_Framework to help understand a situation_



---
# Prototyping
- Developing interactive systems is a creative process 
- Foster creativity
	- Good Designers have methods to do so 
- Adapt methods pragmatically
- Prototyping enables rapid feedback on design ideas
- Different kinds for different purposes and design stages
- Low-fidelity vs. medium-fidelity vs. high-fidelity
- Many approaches, methods, and tools



---
# Design Rules
- Design Rules help directing and evaluating
- Authority and Generality
	- different Levels
- Principles of Heuristics
	- Small Set of generally applicapable heuristics
- Guidelines
	- Concrete Advice and Conventions for given Platform
- Standarts
- Design is a complex Process
 - Even with good guidelines


 
---
# Evaluation 1
- Evaluate to ensure system matches users’ needs
- Evaluation should happen throughout the design process
	- By experts (analytically)
	- By users (experimentally)
	- Cognitive models, quantitative models
- A plethora of methods to evaluate designs
	- Decide when to apply which
- Treat testers with respect at all times!



--- 
# Evaluation 2
- Carefully log data
- Explore data graphically
	- Box plots
	- Histograms
	- Scatter plots
- Summarize data
	- Mean, median
	- Standard deviation
	- Range, min, max, quartiles
- Test whether the results are systematic
	- Statistical analysis (t-test, ANOVA, χ2-test)
