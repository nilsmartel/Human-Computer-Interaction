### (JND) What is the *Just noticable difference*?
>	The smallest change of luminance, weight, pressure etc. a human can feel

### What is *Webers Law*?
>	Webers Law describes the JND
	
	I := {Luminance, Pressure, Weight, etc. }
	k : âˆ†I / I	
	l := 1%-2% of Luminance, Pressurem Weight etc.
>  According th Webers Law is the _Just Noticable Difference_
> 
> *1%-2%* of change

### How much capacity does the *Short Term Memory* have?
> - Max: 5-9 Units for 2 Seconds
> - Typical: 2-4 Units for 7 Seconds

### What *Types of Knowledge* exist?
> - **Declarative**		_easy to note, teach. Hard to learn_
> 	- Facts	(e.g Hannover is West of Berlin)
> 	- Rules	(e.g. Stop at a red light)
> - **Procedural**		_Hard to teach, learned by practice_
> 	- e.g. How to play Guitar
